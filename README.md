===============

ECE 2524 final project. An implementation of AES and message sending.
<h2>Usage</h2>
For the server: Start the server with python server.py
For the client: Start the client with python client.py username host port key

Where host is the IP where the server is located, the port is the port over which the connection is established.
The username is purely for identification and can be anything you want.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
python3, unix-like system.

<h2>Description</h2>
A server-client chat protocol that uses AES-256 for secure communication.

<h2>Limitations</h2>
Unfortunately we were not able to get our original client/server code to work so in order to demonstrate our AES implementation we modified server/client code found at the following site to demonstrate our implementation of AES.
